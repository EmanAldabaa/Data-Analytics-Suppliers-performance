# Data-Analytics-Suppliers-performance: Solving Business Problems.
# Overview:
This project showcases the application of data analytics techniques to analyze shipments data obtained from a freight forwarding company.
focusing on measuring supplier performance, identifying trends, patterns, and costs associated with shipment delays, and assessing their impact on the company's service levels. 
The goal is to uncover insights that are crucial for optimizing operational efficiency.

# Business Problem
- Extract, Clean, and Analyze Data: Extracted shipment data from operational systems, cleaned it to anonymise and to handle missing values and outliers, and conduct in-depth analysis.
- Identify Supplier Performance Trends: Analyze supplier performance metrics to identify strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement.
- Optimize Operational Efficiency: Provide insights to reduce shipment delays, improve on-time delivery rates, and minimize operational costs.
  
# Dataset
The dataset used in this project was extracted from a shipping company's operational systems.

# Project Workflow:

# 1- Data Collection:
Extracted Global Shipments data from the operational systems of a freight forwarding company.Original file contained (Global shipments for one of the company's top customer with Rows: 5869 – Columns:49).

# 2- Data Exploration & Cleaning:

- Original data( Rows: 5869 – Columns:49)
- Data after cleaning and  anonymizing (Rows: 955 – Columns: 20) Limited to Air-shipments from DK for a better analysis results.
- Data Anonymization: The dataset contained sensitive business information, and I ensured compliance with confidentiality agreements by anonymizing the data before analysis using Pandas liberary.
- Due to the reason mentined above, I've only uploading 2 notebooks out of a total of 5 notebooks ensuring compliance with the confrdentiality agreement.
- Explored the data, looking at diffrent parameters, fx ( the total number of shipments per supplier, the total number of shipment per destination country)
- Conducted thorough data cleaning to handle missing values, outliers, and ensure data quality.
  
# 3- Data Analysis:

Analyzed shipment volumes, delays, and costs to derive actionable insights.
Utilized Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib for data manipulation, visualization, and analysis.

# 4- Visualization and Insights:

Created visualizations including line charts, pie charts, and bar plots to illustrate findings.
Uncovered insights on shipment trends, delays,reasons of delays.
# Tools and Libraries Used:
Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

# Results
Key Findings:
Identified peak shipment months and carriers.
Analyzed the impact of delays on overall costs.
Proposed recommendations to enhance on-time delivery rates and reduce costs.
Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of data analytics to solve business challenges related to supplier performance and shipment delays. By analyzing anonymized data, businesses can make informed decisions to optimize operations and improve customer satisfaction.

# Future Enhancements
Implement predictive analytics models for forecasting shipment volumes and potential delays.
Integrate real-time data streams for continuous monitoring and proactive decision-making.
Explore additional factors influencing shipment delays such as weather conditions and geopolitical factors.
Develop actionable recommendations based on the insights uncovered.
